(Comparable state score: 1.129.) <br />
 <ul>This value (F) is the sum of keywords found across the state's core academic standards as well as the state's CTE/career standards. This total count is broken down by keyword and discipline area below.<br /><br />
 On this site, 'comparable scores' are calculated as: keywords found (for a subject) divided by total words (in the subject's standards document(s). The comparable scores attempt to normalize data, at least accounting for the very different sizes of a state's standards.
