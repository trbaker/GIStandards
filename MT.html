This total count is broken down by keyword and discipline area below.<br><br>On this site, 'comparable scores' are calculated as: keywords found (for a subject) divided by total words (in the subject's standards document(s) - multiplied by 100,000. The comparable scores attempt to normalize data, at least accounting for the very different sizes of a state's standards.</ul>Frequencies by <a href="https://trbaker.github.io/GIStandards/appendix_keywords.html">keyword or phrase</a>:<ul><li> spatial: 5</li><li>geospatial: 1</li></ul>Frequencies by discipline area (ELA, MA, SC, SS, or CTE): <ul><li>SS: 3  (Comparable score: 12.37)</li><li>SC: 2  (Comparable score: 2.21)</li><li>MA: None  (Comparable score: None)</li><li>ELA: 1  (Comparable score: 0.443)</li><li>CTE: None  (Comparable score: None)</li></ul></ul>Review the standards document(s) used in this search and analysis (<a target="new" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jduymro0lysperq/AABZAPe4mNCqqD5cJWbD98N9a?dl=0">external link</a>).<br><br>Examples of keyword use by discipline area (and document):  <ul><li>ELA</li><ul><li>MCS-ELA-3rd.pdf, page:10, position:1182<br> believed, suspected, heard, wondered).
