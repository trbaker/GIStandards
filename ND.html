(Comparable state score: 0.524.) <br /><ul>This frequency is the sum of keywords found in all of this state's four core academic standards and the state's CTE/career standards. This total count is broken down by keyword and discipline area below.<br><br>On this site, 'comparable scores' are calculated as: keywords found (for a subject) divided by total words (in the subject's standards document(s) - multiplied by 100,000. The comparable scores attempt to normalize data, at least accounting for the very different sizes of a state's standards.</ul>Frequencies by <a href="https://trbaker.github.io/GIStandards/appendix_keywords.html">keyword or phrase</a>:<ul><li> spatial: 6</li><li>GIS: 3</li></ul>Frequencies by discipline area (ELA, MA, SC, SS, or CTE): <ul><li>SS: 3  (Comparable score: 2.21)</li><li>SC: 2  (Comparable score: 0.372)</li><li>MA: 1  (Comparable score: 0.226)</li><li>ELA: 1  (Comparable score: 0.252)</li><li>CTE: 2  (Comparable score: 0.973)</li></ul></ul>Review the standards document(s) used in this search and analysis (<a href="">external link</a>).<br><br>Examples of keyword use by discipline area (and document):  <ul><li>CTE</li><ul><li>CTE Information Tech.pdf, page:6, position:2678<br> TCPIP concepts, DNS, digital certificates, and the OP security extensions.
