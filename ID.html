(Comparable state score: 1.127.) <br /><ul>This frequency is the sum of keywords found in all of this state's four core academic standards and the state's CTE/career standards. This total count is broken down by keyword and discipline area below.<br><br>On this site, 'comparable scores' are calculated as: keywords found (for a subject) divided by total words (in the subject's standards document(s) - multiplied by 100,000. The comparable scores attempt to normalize data, at least accounting for the very different sizes of a state's standards.</ul>Frequencies by <a href="https://trbaker.github.io/GIStandards/appendix_keywords.html">keyword or phrase</a>:<ul><li> spatial: 19</li><li>Geographic Information System: 2</li><li>GIS: 3</li></ul>Frequencies by discipline area (ELA, MA, SC, SS, or CTE): <ul><li>SS: 18  (Comparable score: 10.72)</li><li>SC: 2  (Comparable score: 0.643)</li><li>MA: 1  (Comparable score: 0.241)</li><li>ELA: 1  (Comparable score: 0.264)</li><li>CTE: 2  (Comparable score: 0.233)</li></ul></ul>Review the standards document(s) used in this search and analysis (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yug6nbmukhd8uha/AAA5wW0CqjMoJfA5VDS7kpMDa?dl=0">external link</a>).<br><br>Examples of keyword use by discipline area (and document):  <ul><li>CTE</li><ul><li>Ecology-Natural-Resource-Management-Program-Standards-RV-12_30_20.pdf, page:2, position:2321<br> the role of fuel management and the relationship between fuel load and fire effects in rangeland and forest ecosystems.
