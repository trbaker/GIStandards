# Project Status

#### Project status and feedback
As of June 15, 2021, the standards documents have been collected and the Python script for data reporting is finalized.  If you find errors or have concerns about any part of this work, please email: trbaker@gmail.com

#### Timelines and milestones
Project Updates:
- Databases and Python engine are ready
- A state-by-state collection of standards is built. Retreiving on-the-fly proved too problematic.

 Phase 1 (complete):
- Gather standards documents
- Use Python to read each of five core U.S. K-12 state curriculum standards document collections.
- Log number of occurences from keyword list.
- Log total number of words.
- Log standard with structured id tag, by state, standard, and date.
- Publish HTML files by state for report out.
- Publish overview report.

Phase 2:
- Account for concept blocks - places where keywords are used multiple times to address a single concept/standard.
