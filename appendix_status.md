# Project Status

#### Project status and feedback
As of June 1, 2021, the standards are being collected and the analysis script is being finalized.  A phase 1 release is targeted for mid  June 2021. If you find errors or have concerns about any part of this work, please email: trbaker@gmail.com

#### Timelines and milesontes
Project Updates:
- Databases and Python engine are ready
- A state-by-state collection of standards is being built. Retreiving on-the-fly proved too problematic.

 Phase 1:
- Gather standards documents
- Use Python to read each of five core U.S. K-12 state curriculum standards document collections.
- Log number of occurences from keyword list.
- Log total number of words.
- Log standard with structured id tag, by state, standard, and date.
- Publish HTML files by state for report out.
- Publish overview report.

Phase 2:
- Log over time to understand spatial, temporal patterns.
- Account for concept blocks - places where keywords are used multiple times to address a single concept/standard.
