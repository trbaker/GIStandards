(Comparable state score: 0.344.) <br /><ul>This frequency is the sum of keywords found in all of this state's four core academic standards and the state's CTE/career standards. This total count is broken down by keyword and discipline area below.<br><br>On this site, 'comparable scores' are calculated as: keywords found (for a subject) divided by total words (in the subject's standards document(s) - multiplied by 100,000. The comparable scores attempt to normalize data, at least accounting for the very different sizes of a state's standards.</ul>Frequencies by <a href="https://trbaker.github.io/GIStandards/appendix_keywords.html">keyword or phrase</a>:<ul><li> spatial: 11</li><li>geospatial: 1</li><li>GIS: 13</li></ul>Frequencies by discipline area (ELA, MA, SC, SS, or CTE): <ul><li>SS: 3  (Comparable score: 3.495)</li><li>SC: 2  (Comparable score: 0.389)</li><li>MA: 2  (Comparable score: 0.722)</li><li>ELA: 1  (Comparable score: 0.375)</li><li>CTE: 17  (Comparable score: 0.278)</li></ul></ul>Review the standards document(s) used in this search and analysis (<a target="new" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cs6ka3tbgqmjw0o/AACZ9jbKSbeDDAV9vaVlI8-xa?dl=0">external link</a>).<br><br>Examples of keyword use by discipline area (and document):  <ul><li>CTE</li><ul><li>Animal-Science-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:12, position:512<br> versus the concept of animal rights 5.1.2 Research the basis for general concerns regarding animal welfare PERFORMANCE STANDARD 5.2 : DISCUSS HISTORICAL EVENTS, CHANGING ATTITUDES AND LEGISLATION REGARDING ANIMAL USE 5.2.1 Explore the h<li>Natural-Resources-and-Wildlife-Management-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:2, position:1373<br> 4  Content Standard 5.0 Œ Fire Ecology Dynamics ........................................................................................... 5  Content Standard 6.0 Œ GPSGIS ................................................<li>Natural-Resources-and-Wildlife-Management-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:11, position:185<br><li>Natural-Resources-and-Wildlife-Management-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:11, position:378<br> GPSGIS IN NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE STANDARD 6.1 : INVESTIGATE GPSGIS SYSTEMS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS 6.1.1 Define the uses of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis as it applies to natural  resource mana<li>Natural-Resources-and-Wildlife-Management-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:29, position:186<br><li>Health-Information-Management-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:9, position:183<br><li>Fashion-Textiles-and-Design-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:9, position:1761<br> machine and dryer 3.3.5 Differentiate between wet and dry cleaning methods 3.3.6 Describe the steps in textile preservation and storage  PERFORMANCE STANDARD 3.4 :  SUMMARIZE TEXTILE LEGISLATION, STANDARDS, AND LABELING 3.4.1 Utilize<li>Health-Science-I-and-II-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:7, position:305<br> 3.0 : UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL AND ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE STANDARD 3.1 : PERFORM DUTIES ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS, POLICIES, LAWS, AND LEGISLATED RIGHTS OF CLIENTS  3.1.1 Describe laws c<li>Interior_Design_STDS.pdf, page:5, position:1562<br> the components of a business plan  1.3.5 Research the legal requirements and resources needed for starting a business  PERFORMANCE STANDARD 1.4: DEMONSTRATE AWARENESS OF REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PROFESSIONAL ORGANI<li>Environmental-Management-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:2, position:1222<br> 3 Content Standard 4.0 Œ Exploring Concepts of Sustainable Use .................................................................. 4 Content Standard 5.0 Œ Using GIS AND GPS .......................................<li>Environmental-Management-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:10, position:122<br><li>Environmental-Management-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:10, position:540<br>  5.1.3 Explain how a GPS unit acquires its signals to define a location PERFORMANCE STANDARD 5.2 :  USE GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS SOFTWARE 5.2.1 Investigate Google Earth functions for geospatial analysis  5.2.2 Use other GIS software (i.e.<li>Environmental-Management-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:29, position:122<br><li>Manufacturing-Technologies-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:7, position:1372<br> caliper)  3.2.5 Utilize measurement systems to solve real manufacturing problems PERFORMANCE STANDARD 3.3 :  DEMONSTRATE SPATIAL REASONING AND 3D MODELING TECHNIQUES 3.3.1 Define spatial reasoning 3.3.2 Identify spatial reasoning techn<li>Family-and-Consumer-Sciences-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:8, position:1382<br> and storage) 3.3.4 Demonstrate the safe use and care of a washing machine and dryer 3.3.5 Differentiate between wet and dry cleaning methods PERFORMANCE STANDARD 3.4 :  SUMMARIZE TEXTILE LEGISLATION, STANDARDS, AND LABELING 3.4.1 Utilize<li>Architectural-Design-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:5, position:1520<br> lines (i.e., styles and weights)  1.3.4 Annotate sketches legibly using an appropriate architectural lettering style PERFORMANCE STANDARD 1.4:  DEMONSTRATE SPATIAL REASONING 1.4.1 Define spatial reasoning 1.4.2 Identify spatial reasoning techn<li>Architectural-Design-STDS-ADA.pdf, page:9, position:1697<br> 4.9 : PREPARE ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS 4.9.1 Transcribe a floor plan from an existing plan 4.9.2 Transcribe a site plan from an existing plan using geographic data (e.g., GIS, maps, and aerials) 4.9.3 Draw an exterior ele</ul><li>ELA</li><ul><li>K-12_ELA_Standards_ADA_Accessible.pdf, page:55, position:1674<br> to better understand each of the words. 6.
