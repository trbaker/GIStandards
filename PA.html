(Comparable state score: 1.888.) <br /><ul>This frequency is the sum of keywords found in all of this state's four core academic standards and the state's CTE/career standards. This total count is broken down by keyword and discipline area below.<br><br>On this site, 'comparable scores' are calculated as: keywords found (for a subject) divided by total words (in the subject's standards document(s) - multiplied by 100,000.
