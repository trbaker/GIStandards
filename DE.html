(Comparable state score: 0.827.) <br /><ul>This frequency is the sum of keywords found in all of this state's four core academic standards and the state's CTE/career standards. This total count is broken down by keyword and discipline area below.<br><br>On this site, 'comparable scores' are calculated as: keywords found (for a subject) divided by total words (in the subject's standards document(s) - multiplied by 100,000. The comparable scores attempt to normalize data, at least accounting for the very different sizes of a state's standards.</ul>Frequencies by <a href="https://trbaker.github.io/GIStandards/appendix_keywords.html">keyword or phrase</a>:<ul><li> spatial: 2</li><li>GIS: 1</li></ul>Frequencies by discipline area (ELA, MA, SC, SS, or CTE): <ul><li>SS: None  (Comparable score: None)</li><li>SC: None  (Comparable score: None)</li><li>MA: 2  (Comparable score: 0.805)</li><li>ELA: None  (Comparable score: None)</li><li>CTE: 1  (Comparable score: 0.876)</li></ul></ul>Review the standards document(s) used in this search and analysis (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yug6nbmukhd8uha/AAA5wW0CqjMoJfA5VDS7kpMDa?dl=0">external link</a>).<br><br>Examples of keyword use by discipline area (and document):  <ul><li>CTE</li><ul><li>CTE_POS_Matrix_GST_Template_2019.pdf, page:1, position:621<br> !?@1AB&!2*65C."(D*E6)(#:3)2E301.*2,)34!?@>A$&9,F6(!2*65C."(D#:3)2E301.*2,)34   Pre-Apprenticeship  Other:   Other Early College Opportunities    ArcGIS Desktop Entry Level Certification  Certification</ul><li>MA</li><ul><li>ADA_CC_MathStandards.pdf, page:2, position:227<br> greater focus and coherenceMathematics experiences in early childhood settings should concentrate on (1)number (which includes whole number, operations, and relations) and (2)geometry, spatial relations, and measurement, with more mathematics<li>ADA_CC_MathStandards.pdf, page:8, position:1334<br> objects in combined sets, or counting the number of objectsthat remain in a set after some are taken away.(2)Students describe their physical world using geometric ideas (e.g.,shape, orientation, spatial relations) and vocabulary.
