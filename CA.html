This total count is broken down by keyword and discipline area below.<br><br>On this site, 'comparable scores' are calculated as: keywords found (for a subject) divided by total words (in the subject's standards document(s) - multiplied by 100,000. The comparable scores attempt to normalize data, at least accounting for the very different sizes of a state's standards.</ul>Frequencies by <a href="https://trbaker.github.io/GIStandards/appendix_keywords.html">keyword or phrase</a>:<ul><li> spatial: 7</li><li>GIS: 1</li></ul>Frequencies by discipline area (ELA, MA, SC, SS, or CTE): <ul><li>SS: None  (Comparable score: None)</li><li>SC: None  (Comparable score: None)</li><li>MA: 1  (Comparable score: 0.1)</li><li>ELA: None  (Comparable score: None)</li><li>CTE: 7  (Comparable score: 0.181)</li></ul></ul>Review the standards document(s) used in this search and analysis (<a href="">external link</a>).<br><br>Examples of keyword use by discipline area (and document):  <ul><li>CTE</li><ul><li>hosptourrec.pdf, page:38, position:639<br> prod-B1.0, B11.0, B12.0C1.0, C4.0, C8.0ucts.12.2.10.
