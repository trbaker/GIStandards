# GIStandards
#### A machine analysis of geospatial language in US K-12 state standards
#### Project URL: http://trbaker.github.io/GIStandards

Updates:

- Last updated: May 25, 2021
- Databases and Python engine are ready
- A state-by-state collection of standards is being built. Retreiving on-the-fly proved too problematic.   

 Phase 1:

- <a target="new" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/deaf3jrb48a6amf/AAA56gcQ_P1D6msnaNR5PeY9a?dl=0">Gather standards documents</a>
- Use Python to read each of five core U.S. K-12 state curriculum standards documents.
- Log number of occurences from keyword list. 
- Log total number of words.
- Log standard with structured id tag, by state, standard, and date.
- Public HTML files by state for report out.
- Publish meta report.


Phase 2:
- Log over time to understand spatial, temporal patterns.
- Account for concept blocks - places where keywords are used multiple times to address a single concept/standard.


## This repo only contains the HTML output.  This output is dated and is overwritten/updated on a regular basis.  I recommend 'starring' the repo - rather than cloning it.
