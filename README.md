# GIStandards
A machine analysis of geospatial language in US K-12 state standards

Phase 1:
Use Python to retrieve and reach each of five core U.S. state standards documents.
Log number of occurences from keyword list. Account for concept blocks - places where keywords are used multiple times to address a single concept/standard.
Log total number of words.
Log standard with structured id tag, by state, standard, and date.
Log over time to understand spatial, temporal patterns.

Public HTML files by state for report out.
Publish meta report.

## This repo only contains the HTML output.  This output is dated and is overwritten/updated on a regular basis.  I recommend 'starring' the repo - rather than cloning it.
