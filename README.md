# GIStandards
A machine analysis of geospatial language in US K-12 state standards

Phase 1:
<ul>
<li>Use Python to read each of five core U.S. K-12 state curriculum standards documents.
<li>Log number of occurences from keyword list. 
<LI>Log total number of words.
<li>Log standard with structured id tag, by state, standard, and date.
<li>Public HTML files by state for report out.
<li>Publish meta report.
  </ul>
  Phase 2:
  <ul>
<li>Log over time to understand spatial, temporal patterns.
  <LI>Account for concept blocks - places where keywords are used multiple times to address a single concept/standard.
</ul>
