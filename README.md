# GIStandards
#### A machine analysis of geospatial language in US K-12 state standards
#### Project URL: http://trbaker.github.io/GIStandards

Updates:
<ul>
 <li>Last updated: May 25, 2021
 <LI>Databases and Python engine are ready
 <li>A state-by-state collection of standards is being built. Retreiving on-the-fly proved too problematic.   
 </ul>
 
Phase 1:
<ul>
<li><a target="new" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/deaf3jrb48a6amf/AAA56gcQ_P1D6msnaNR5PeY9a?dl=0">Gather standards documents</a>
  <LI>Use Python to read each of five core U.S. K-12 state curriculum standards documents.
<li>Log number of occurences from keyword list. 
<LI>Log total number of words.
<li>Log standard with structured id tag, by state, standard, and date.
<li>Public HTML files by state for report out.
<li>Publish meta report.
  </ul>
  Phase 2:
  <ul>
<li>Log over time to understand spatial, temporal patterns.
  <LI>Account for concept blocks - places where keywords are used multiple times to address a single concept/standard.
</ul>

## This repo only contains the HTML output.  This output is dated and is overwritten/updated on a regular basis.  I recommend 'starring' the repo - rather than cloning it.
